# About Me

Hi! I am Jesal. I'm a designer, educator and maker. I have always been making things as far as I can remember, from papier-mache as a child to products as a professional.

I am developing curriculum as well as teaching various aspects of Product Design at [the Somaiya School of Design](https://ssd.somaiya.edu/about/index.html), with an interest in New Media and Emergent technologies, as well as traditional crafts and materials. I am also into Generative Art and Data Visualisation.

My current personal interest is bringing generative art into the physical realm as objects, interactions and experiences.
Apart from design and making, I am a student of history, occasional poet, and sometime cyclist.  

My next deep dive will probably be Speculative Design and Design Fiction, connecting the dots between history and design.

### Previous work

With a background in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design, I have worked in Lighting, Healthcare and other domains.
As founding faculty at NMIMS School of Design, I have also developed curriculum and taught Product Design as well as New media there.

I was also an active member of the local maker community for years at [Maker's Asylum](https://makersasylum.com/) before the lockdown. â€‹
At my home studio, I have a few powertools, electronics and a Prusa 3D Printer that I assembled from kit. Living in Mumbai, I have also probably spent as much time building efficient storage for "Stuff" as I have spent on building the "Stuff" itself.


### Projects

My coolest professional project - so far - has been [the Clubfoot Brace](https://www.jesalmehta.com/work/development-of-brace-for-clubfoot-therapy/).

I also like making things for people. For a good friend's birthday, I created this helical paperfold lamp. The body/lampshade is paper, while the based is 3D printed. A bulbholder with an LED bulb are screwed into the base and the wire path goes from underneath in the gap provided.
